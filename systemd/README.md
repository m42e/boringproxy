# Installing Service

A service is a program that runs in the background outside the interactive control of system users. Services can also be automatically started on boot.

*The systemd service instructions were written for Linux*

# Prerequisites

## Install boringproxy
The folling steps assume that boringproxy is already installed. If you haven't installed the server, follow [installation](https://boringproxy.io/installation/) instructions in the documentation.

Boringproxy needs to be installed in **/usr/local/bin/boringproxy** for the default service file to work. If you want to use another path, this can be changed in the service file.

Remember to allow binding to ports 80 and 443 for non root users using setcap:

```bash
setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/local/bin/boringproxy
```


## Create boringproxy user & group
The service will be run as user *boringproxy*. Running the service as *root* is not recommended.

Add user *boringproxy*
```bash
useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/boringproxy/ -m boringproxy;
```

Add group *boringproxy*
```bash
groupadd boringproxy;
```

Add user *boringproxy* to group *boringproxy*
```bash
usermod -a -G boringproxy boringproxy
```

Create SSH folder for user. BoringProxy assumes the folder already exists. If it does not exist, the program will fail to add tunnels.
```bash
mkdir /home/boringproxy/.ssh
chown boringproxy:boringproxy /home/boringproxy/.ssh
```

## Server

Installing the service on a boringproxy server

### Download service file

Copy service file from GitHub
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m42e/boringproxy/master/systemd/boringproxy-server.service
```

### Edit service file to include your setup information

#### Working Directory

Default working directory is */home/boringproxy/*, you can change this in the service file to another directory.

The default directory will be created as part of the user add command. If you choose another directory make sure it exists

#### Boringproxy executable file path

Default location for your boringproxy executable file is */usr/local/bin/boringproxy*, you can change this in the service file to another path.

Move file from the downloaded directory to */usr/local/bin/boringproxy*
```bash
mv ./boringproxy /usr/local/bin/boringproxy
```

#### ExecStart

Edit the service file and change *bp.example.com* to your admin-domain (the main domain configured in DNS).


### Install service file to systemd

Copy service file to */etc/systemd/system/*
```bash
mv ./boringproxy-server.service /etc/systemd/system/
```
Reload the service files to include the new service.
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Manual start (once off only)
When boringproxy start for the first time, it requires a manual input of your email address. This email address will be used when registering Certificates with Let's Encrypt.

By stating the server manually, you can enter the required information and ensure the server is starting correctly under the new user.

To start the server, you will need to change the current directory to your WorkingDirectory (as indicated in your service file) and then run the ExecStart command (as indicated in your service file). If you made changes to the default WorkingDirectory or boringproxy executable file path, change the command below accordingly.

If no changes were made to the default paths, change the *admin-domain* in the command below to your *admin-domain* and enter your email address when prompted
```bash
runuser -l boringproxy -c 'cd /home/boringproxy; /usr/local/bin/boringproxy server -admin-domain bp.example.com'
```

If your server was successfully started, close the running process and start it again using the service.

Since the process was started as a different user, you will have to kill the foreground process (***Ctrl + C***) as well as close the process started as user *boringproxy*.

To kill all running processes for user *boringproxy*, use the command below:
```bash
pkill -u boringproxy
```

To check if **boringproxy** is still running, you can look if a process is listening on port 443 using:
```bash
netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN | grep 443
```
If nothing is returned, no process is currently using port 443. Alternatively you will receive a result like:

*tcp6  0  0 :::443   :::  LISTEN  9461/boringproxy*

### Service commands

After the above steps are completed, you can execute the service by using the commands below.

Start your service
```bash
systemctl start boringproxy-server.service
```

To check the status of your service
```bash
systemctl status boringproxy-server.service
```

To enable your service on every reboot
```bash
systemctl enable boringproxy-server.service
```

To disable your service on every reboot
```bash
systemctl disable boringproxy-server.service
```

## Client

Installing the service on a boringproxy client

### Download service file

Copy service file from GitHub
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m42e/boringproxy/master/systemd/boringproxy-client.service
```

### Edit service file to include your setup information

#### Working Directory

Default working directory is */home/boringproxy/*, you can change this in the service file to another directory.

The default directory will be created as part of the user add command. If you choose another directory make sure it exists

#### Boringproxy executable file path

Default location for your boringproxy executable file is */usr/local/bin/boringproxy*, you can change this in the service file to another path.

Move file from the downloaded directory to */usr/local/bin/boringproxy*
```bash
mv ./boringproxy /usr/local/bin/boringproxy
```

#### ExecStart

Edit the service file and change the following:
- **bp.example.com** to your *admin-domain*
- **your-bp-server-token** to your user token
- **your-email-address** your email address to register with Let's Encrypt


### Install service file to systemd

Copy service file to */etc/systemd/system/*
*You can change your-server-name to any name you want to identify the server. This is useful when connecting your client device to multiple servers using different client services.*
```bash
mv ./boringproxy-client.service /etc/systemd/system/boringproxy-client.service
```
Reload the service files to include the new service.
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Service commands

After the above steps are completed, you can execute the service by using the commands below.

Start your service
```bash
systemctl start boringproxy-client.service
```

To check the status of your service
```bash
systemctl status boringproxy-client.service
```

To enable your service on every reboot
```bash
systemctl enable boringproxy-client.service
```

To disable your service on every reboot
```bash
systemctl disable boringproxy-client.service
```
